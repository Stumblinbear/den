## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `PostToolUse` and `UserPromptSubmit` hook measuring the session's context
  from the transcript's newest non-sidechain assistant turn and injecting a
  notice, then an urgent message, as it crosses per-model thresholds. Each
  level injects once and re-arms if the context falls back below it.
- `hooks/config.toml`: absolute `notice`/`urgent` token thresholds, per-model
  rows keyed by a regex on the model id (`enabled = false` switches a model
  off; Haiku ships that way), and both injected messages, all overridable from
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/config.toml`.
- Skill `context-budget`: the two rewind summarize directions, `/compact` with
  a focus line, picking and describing a cut point, and judging a stopping
  point by task.
- Skill `configure`: how the hook measures, why a notice did or did not
  appear, where overrides go and how they merge, and how to check an edit.
- `PreToolUse` gate on `SendMessage`, moved from den: denies resuming a
  subagent whose context is above 150K tokens, or above 50K with an expired
  prompt cache, until the user picks "Resume" in an AskUserQuestion prompt.
  `RESUME_GATE_LARGE_TOKENS` and `RESUME_GATE_COLD_TOKENS` override the limits.
- `smol-toml` as the plugin's one dependency, installed by Claude Code's
  `npm ci --ignore-scripts` when it caches the plugin. A session where that
  install did not happen gets one stderr line naming the fix, then silence.
